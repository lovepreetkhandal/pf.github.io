									</a></h2>
									<p>Our client, a grocery retailer, sent out mailers in a marketing campaign for their new delivery club. This cost customers $100 per year for membership, and offered free grocery deliveries, rather than the normal cost of $10 per delivery.

										For this, they sent mailers to their entire customer base (apart from a control group) but this proved expensive. For the next batch of communications they would like to save costs by only mailing customers that were likely to sign up.
										
										Based upon the results of the last campaign and the customer data available, we will look to understand the probability of customers signing up for the delivery club. This would allow the client to mail a more targeted selection of customers, lowering costs, and improving ROI.
										
										Let’s use Machine Learning to take on this task!<br />

									<p>Our client is looking to promote Ed Sheeran’s new album - and want to be both targeted with their customer communications, and as efficient as possible with their marketing budget.

										As a proof-of-concept they would like us to build a classification model for customers who purchased Ed’s last album based upon a small sample of listening data they have acquired for some of their customers at that time.
										
										If we can do this successfully, they will look to purchase up-to-date listening data, apply the model, and use the predicted probabilities to promote to customers who are most likely to purchase.
										
										The sample data is short but wide. It contains only 356 customers, but for each, columns that represent the percentage of historical listening time allocated to each of 100 artists. On top of these, the 100 columns do not contain the artist in question, instead being labelled artist1, artist2 etc.
										
										We will need to compress this data into something more manageable for classification!</p>

									<p>The overall aim of this work is to accurately predict the loyalty score for those customers who could not be tagged, enabling our client a clear understanding of true customer loyalty, regardless of total spend volume - and allowing for more accurate and relevant customer tracking, targeting, and comms.

										To achieve this, we looked to build out a predictive model that will find relationships between customer metrics and loyalty score for those customers who were tagged, and use this to predict the loyalty score metric for those who were not.</p>

									<p>Earlier in the year, our client, a grocery retailer, ran a campaign to promote their new “Delivery Club” - an initiative that costs a customer $100 per year for membership, but offers free grocery deliveries rather than the normal cost of $10 per delivery.

										They want to understand if customers who did join the club have increased their spend in the three months following. The hypothesis is that, if customers are not paying for deliveries, they will be tempted to shop more frequently, and hopefully purchase more each time.
										
										The aim of this work is to understand and quantify the uplift in sales for customers that joined the club, over and above what they would have spent had the club not come into existence!</p>

									<p>The Senior Management team from our client, a supermarket chain, are disagreeing about how customers are shopping, and how lifestyle choices may affect which food areas customers are shopping into, or more interestingly, not shopping into.

										They have asked us to use data, and Machine Learning to help segment up their customers based upon their engagement with each of the major food categories - aiding business understanding of the customer base, and to enhance the relevancy of targeted messaging & customer communications.</p>

									<p>Our client recently spoke with the representative of a Robotics company. Their representative mentioned that they had built a prototype
										for a robotic sort arm that could be used to pick up and move products off a platform. It would use a camera to 'see" the product, and 
										could be programmed to move that particular product into a designated bin, for further processing.
										So, to accurately identify each product using the camera, we trained CNN model for fruit classification so that robotic arm could move 
										the product to a right place using the built model </p>
